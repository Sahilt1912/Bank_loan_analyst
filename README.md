Bank loan analysis involves a thorough assessment of the borrower's creditworthiness. This includes an evaluation of the borrower's credit history, repayment track record, and overall financial health. Lenders use credit scores, income statements, and debt-to-income ratios to gauge the borrower's ability to repay the loan.
